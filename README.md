Abstract:
Ecological interactions are a key component of biodiversity and essential for understanding ecosystem services and functioning. However, consideration of ecological interactions as a component of biodiversity has received limited attention. There is an urgent need to record, quantify and assess ecological interactions to better understand the contribution of biodiversity to ecosystem functioning.
Using a standardized camera trap protocol, we monitor animal-plant interactions in Doñana, a highly valuable national park in SW Spain, collecting field data on frugivore interactions (records of pairwise interactions between plant and frugivore species) from 2018 to 2023. The dataset presented here includes 10,831 frugivory interactions for 60 vertebrate species (50 birds, 10 mammals) recorded on 13 different plant species that dominate the fleshy fruit assemblage of the region. The most recorded species per taxa were: mammals - Cervus elaphus (1671 records) and birds - Sylvia melanocephala (1572 records). The most important general pattern that we note is that deer Cervus elaphus have a central role as an antagonist frugivore species that consumes (but do not disperse) most of the fleshy fruit species in Doñana, performing as a seed sink in this ecosystem. This is opposed to the bird frugivore species such as those from the Sylvidae family that are widespread in the region acting as legit seed dispersers appearing as crucial species to maintain the dispersal service for most focal species.
This study compiles the most comprehensive dataset of frugivory interactions based on field data ever assembled, providing valuable information for the study of animal-plant interactions at the individual and community level from both zoocentric or phytocentric perspectives. The dataset presented provides opportunities for new studies, and the methods designed encourage the implementation of this approach in other regions, allowing a deeper understanding of animal-plant assemblages and interactions as crucial components of biodiversity.
