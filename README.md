# FRUGIVORY CAMTRAP

The goal of the frugivory-camtrap repository is to contain and facilitate access to the data, code and metadata associated to the datapaper published in _Ecology_. 

The folder named "dataset_YYYY_mm_dd" contains the complete dataset in csv format. The dataset will be updated with new field data when available and the folder will contain the date for the last version. The folder named "code" contains a toy dataset for ilustrating the assembling process of the dataset. In this folder you can also find the code for running it. In the code folder you will also find the code for creating the figures contained in the Metadata section of the manuscript.   

This is a public repository for the data and code included in the data paper:

### Abstract
Ecological interactions are a key component of biodiversity, essential for understanding ecosystem services and functioning. Recording and quantifying ecological interactions is challenging, frequently requiring complex logistics and substantial effort in the field. Camera traps are routinely used in ecology for various applications and have proven to be an excellent method for passive and non-invasive sampling of plant-animal interactions. We implemented a standardized camera trap protocol to document vertebrate frugivore-fleshy fruit plant interactions in Doñana National Park, SW Spain with the central objective of inventorying the diversity of plant-animal ecological interactions providing seed dispersal services. From 2018-2023 we recorded pairwise interactions from which we obtained qualitative (presence-absence) and quantitative (frequency of visits) information. Each record in the dataset contains information of a visit by an individual animal to an individual plant, resulting in any form of fleshy-fruit use and provides information on visitation phenology, visit length and feeding behavior. The dataset presented here includes 10,659 frugivory interaction events for 59 vertebrate species (46 birds, 13 mammals) recorded on 339 plant individuals from 13 different plant species which dominate the fleshy-fruited plant assemblage in the Doñana National Park. The most recorded animal species consuming fruits and playing a legitimate seed dispersal role was _Curruca melanocephala_ (1678 records) among birds and _Vulpes vulpes_ among mammals (751 records). _Cervus elaphus_, a fruit consumer with a marginal role as legitimate seed disperser, was the most recorded mammal species (1508 records). Avian frugivores, particularly those from the Sylviidae and Turdidae families, are widespread in the region and play a crucial role in maintaining the dispersal service for the fleshy-fruited plant populations in the area. The dataset offers highly versatile quantitative information that can be used to investigate frugivory from the highest resolution scale, the interaction event between pairs of individuals. In addition, other information that can be extracted includes the timing of interactions of animals and plants (their phenological couplings), activity periods of the animals, behavior during the events and preferences for individual plants within populations.
